#This repository contains the .zip files for each version of the project during development. These versions can also be accessed and utilised by accessing the links in the word document also within this repository. This will allow you to use and access the files in the expo snack environment, which was the developmnent environment when implementing and testing this app. Emulators for iOS and Android are available there, as well as QR codes to run the app on your own device, as long as the Expo Go App is installed.
